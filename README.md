# PicoPi-Demodulator
This is a demodulator multimode AM SSB CW for quadrature input signal (es. taken from ElkSDR-UNO receiver or QRPLab Receiver o similar). The idea is to make a self contained with few controls "sistem on chip" demodulator. Using the ElkDSR-UNO and this project you will obtain a full working SDR receiver. The demodulator includes filtering and noise reduction.

The project is work in progress.

[13.08.2023] - Added new schematic. Apply a good I/Q audio level from an SDR receiver. For the ElkSDR-UNO you can increase the input audio level in using a small pre amplifier.

Pico Pi demodulator (SSB CW AM ) and ElkSDR UNO Receiver as stand alone SDR Receiver.
